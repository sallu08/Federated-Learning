# Federated-Learning
A simple implementation of Federated Learning using MNIST data using Flower Framework
First you must install Flower environment (https://flower.dev/docs/)
Run serverad.py this will start testing data based on initial model (accuracy should be v low)
Then run client files. I am using my own model but you can use any other model such as "convnet"
